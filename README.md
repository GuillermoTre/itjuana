# Itjuana Test

Solution to problems 
Problem 1
Given a list nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, list length], write a function
that solves the following problem; return a list of all the integers in the range [1, list length]
that do not appear in nums.

Problem 2
Given a list of integers nums and an integer target, write a function that solves the following
problem; return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the
same element twice.
